# supra-l1-sdk

The supra-l1-sdk provides a convenient way to interact with the supra chain and perform operations on supra chain.

**NOTE:** This `sdk` utilizes [aptos-sdk](https://aptos-labs.github.io/ts-sdk-doc/) and expects few things such as `keyPair` of `aptos-sdk` type, so due to this you also have to add `aptos-sdk` in your project.

This `sdk` is under development and in future we will try to completely remove dependency from `aptos-sdk`

## Usage

This `sdk` is well documented and you can check [./src/example.ts](https://github.com/Entropy-Foundation/supra-l1-sdk/blob/master/src/example.ts) for understating about the usage.
